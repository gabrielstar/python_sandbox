# Gabriel's Python Learning sandbox

This repository is my personal python learning grounds, however perhaps you can find some useful stuff in here.

---

My objectives are:

-   learn basic python (Brad's courses)
-   write-up a simple machine learning app with Anaconda (neural network model)
-   expose AI model via flask app
-   use Application factory pattern for Flask
-   use pytests for running:
    -   unit tests
    -   api tests (e2e API tests)
    -   flask integration tests (same as api but internal to flask using flask context)
    -   load tests (locust)
    -   contract tests (consumer-driven) with pact

*   learn linting with flake, pep8

---

Optionally

-   configure tox/nox sessions to run tests (in multiple pythin envs) and linting from CLI
-   create JS UI and extend tests with playwright for python with POM etc

---

Once done, reiterate and enrich full stack

# DevOps

-   Package App into Docker container
-   Deploy with a Helm chart on Kubernetes
-   Create a CI/CD pipeline
-   Run Chaos Testing for resiliency
-   Use Keptn to orchestrate deployments and Continuous Performance
