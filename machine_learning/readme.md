# We use Anaconda here

After installation of Anaconda it is best to start VS code from Anaconda navigator.
We develop stuff in Jupyter but can also export code to py files and do some more advanced stuff in VS code. The two work together.
You can export entire env by checking what dependencies you have e.g. with
pip freeze

# pytest parallel testing

Make sure to have ini path in proper location
